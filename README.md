# JS Lab 1: Variables and Functions

## Overview
Practicing creating variables and functions with parameters in Javascript

## Approach
I started by digging into MDN for information on how to capitalize just the first letter of a string. Everything else was pretty simple for me to figure out. I did forget the the discount would be undefined if not given a value, I first tried to add a value of zero to it but then realized that I could just do undefined instead.

## Difficulties
I didn't really have much difficulty completing these. The hardest one for me was the first task, but I quickly figured it out once I discovered charAt(0) for picking the correct character. Then I sliced the string to cut off the first letter and add the capitalized one to the front. 

## Reflection Questions

### How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
I am pretty familiar with functions with parameters, even multiple ones. So My approach is the same as functions without parameters, aside from the fact that I added parameters and then used them to manipulate the data to acheive the desired effect.
### What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
The only challenge I had/have is remembering that elif is not valid in JS! Coming from Python, I get confused sometimes. 
### How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
Refactoring helped make sure that the code remained usable even with added functionality needs.
